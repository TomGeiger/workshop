        "bio": "Meet Tom Geiger, a seasoned software engineer and dedicated partner to Patricia in their shared mission of 'No Family Left Behind' in the realm of financial education. With over 30 years of experience in the technology industry, Tom brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise to the table. His passion for technology is matched only by his fervent commitment to financial literacy. Growing up in middle-class America, Tom experienced firsthand the lack of financial education in traditional schooling. It wasn't until later in life, upon realizing that the conventional wisdom of relying solely on a 401(k) for retirement wasn't sufficient, that he embarked on a quest for financial knowledge. Driven by a desire to understand how money truly works and how individuals can achieve financial security, Tom is dedicated to sharing his insights and experiences with others. Through his partnership with Patricia and their joint efforts to educate and empower families, Tom aims to demystify the complexities of personal finance and guide others toward a path of financial freedom and abundance.",
